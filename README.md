# Synapse X UI For Nova
A Synapse X Custom UI for the Nova Executor. This project was forked from synz's custom synapse x ui because i didnt want to set up all of the stuff from the synapse x source leak.

## Downloading
Drag the `Module.dll` & `Injector.exe` files from nova to the newly extracted folder where the synapse x custom ui is in.
